Terminus
--------

This is a metro-themed map designed by Honoré “newin” Jaussoin for the [Urban Terror](http://www.urbanterror.info) game. This project aims to port it to the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game.

This map was already ported to Tremulous in the past, but it was'nt made cleanly: the porter had decompiled and recompiled it, and many issues were introduced. Since newin does not have his sources anymore, and to avoid an unreliable decompilation process, this port is done using the [Granger's gardening toolbox](https://github.com/illwieckz/grtoolbox) which provides a tool to edit BSP file.

This map was named _“Metro”_ on Urban Terror, it is named _“Terminus”_ on Unvanquished to avoid conflicts with an homonym map by KOsAD.
